This way we will get multiple cosine similarity values for each sentence corresponding to its similarity with each sentence. All these values are added up to create a raw value. All raw values are then normalized by dividing each of them with the highest raw value in the document. This feature can also be called **Sentence Cohesion**.\n",

Main Concept Indicator- If a particular noun occurs considerable times in a sentence then we can consider it a main concept, meaning, it must have some value in predicting the sentence's occurence in the summary. So, we calculate the number of nouns in the document along with each of their frequency. The noun with the highest frequencies (5) are then considered main concepts. The sentence which contain these values will be then tagged *True* for occurence in summary. Rest will be *false*.\n",
